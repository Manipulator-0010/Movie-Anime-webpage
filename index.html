            <h1 id="link-3">watching anime and why you should watch it</h1>
            <p>There is a lot of misconception that has been going around about anime. If you are the kind of person that likes watching anime, there is a chance that people will ridicule you, saying that you have a weird taste of entertainment. Scrap all that and let us start over. All the misconception was a thing of the past because right now, there is a lot of acceptance of anime in western cultures and around the world. This is in part because people have finally realized the benefits that anime presents.</p>
            <p>Viewers of any kind of media can be classified into two main groups, that is, passive and active media consumers. Passive consumers are usually not involved fully in the content they are watching. They just watch the content idly because the device showing it in front of them. As a result, these people only gain 40% of the content being displayed.

                On the other hand, we have active consumers who become fully engaged when they are watching content. They pay attention to the sounds and visuals coming from the content and digest it as they continue watching. As a result, these people usually gain over 60% of the value of the content.</p>
                <p>We all go through a phase in our lives where we feel like nobody understands us or what we are going through. Whether you are lost in angst in your teenage years or feeling confused in your early twenties, you are not alone. We all have been there at some point in our lives and how you handle that stage of your life is what will matter. You can’t open up to anyone because you don’t think they will understand what you are going through.

                    Well, you shouldn’t worry because with anime, you will come across characters who are going through exactly the same thing. The characters are so relatable and they can actually help you pull through whatever difficulty you are going through in your life. Anime is the right kind of entertainment for people who feel this way because they can help them to pull through times like these.</p>
                    <p>Cool down. I’m not trying to initiate you into a cult. When you watch anime, you become part of a community of anime watchers. Don’t ever be fooled into thinking that the people in your circles don’t watch anime. In fact, there is a lot of social stigma surrounding anime that there are so many people who are not willing to come out as anime lovers.</p>

            <h1>Music</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The opening and credits sequences of most anime television series are accompanied by J-pop or J-rock songs, often by reputed bands—as written with the series in mind—but are also aimed at the general music market, therefore they often allude only vaguely or not at all, to the thematic settings or plot of the series. Also, they are often used as incidental music ("insert songs") in an episode, in order to highlight particularly important scenes.</p>

        <div id="paragraph">
            <h1>Genres</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Anime are often classified by target demographic, including children's (子供, kodomo), girls' (少女, shōjo), boys' (少年, shōnen) and a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience. Shoujo and shounen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of both sexes in an attempt to gain crossover appeal. Adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences may typically find unappealing.</p>

        <div id="paragraph">
            <h1>Format</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Early anime works were made for theatrical viewing, and required played musical components before sound and vocal components were added to the production. In 1958, Nippon Television aired Mogura no Abanchūru ("Mole's Adventure"), both the first televised and first color anime to debut.[77] It was not until the 1960s when the first televised series were broadcast and it has remained a popular medium since.[78] Works released in a direct.</p>
